# Dropping ACPI Tables
Sometimes ACPI Tables provided with your Firmware/BIOS might hinder some features or devices to work properly in macOS. Boot managers like Clover an OpenCore provide means to prohibit certain tables from loading or to replace them. In order to do so, you need to know the Tables Signature, OEM Table ID and/or Table Length. Therefore, you need to dump the existing ACPI tables from your BIOS/Firmware to analyze them.

## Preparations: Dumping the ACPI Tables
There are various ways of dumping ACPI Tables from your Firmware/BIOS. The most common way is to use either Clover or OpenCore:

- Using **Clover** (the easiest method): Hit `F4` in the Boot Menu. You don't even need a working configuration to do this. Just download the latest [**Release**](https://github.com/CloverHackyColor/CloverBootloader/releases) as a `.zip` file, extract it, put it on a FAT32 formatted USB flash drive and boot from it. The dumped ACPI Tables will be located in: `EFI/CLOVER/ACPI/origin`
- Using **OpenCore** (requires the Debug version and a working config): enable `Misc/Debug/SysReport` Quirk. The ACPI Tables will be dumped during next boot.

## Method 1: Dropping Tables based on OEM Tabled ID
This method is used to drop tables such as SSDTs and others which have a *distinct* OEM Table ID in the header to describe them. In this example we drop `CpuPm`.

- Open the Table you want to drop in maciASL and find its Table Signature and OEM Table ID:</br>

- Open your config.plist and a new rule under "ACPI" > "Delete"
- Add the discovered `TableSignature` (here "53534454" = "SSDT" in HEX) and `OEMTableID` (here "437075506D000000" = "CpuPm" in HEX) into the corresponding fields in HEX format. In OCAT, you can use the ASCII to HEX converter at the bottom of the app to do this:</br>
![DropCpuPM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76865553/140036351-785f42b6-b0e6-43b3-9eb0-c6729c863a90.png)
- Enable the rule and save your config.plist.
- Reboot.

### Verifying that the table has been dropped
- Open maciASL
- Select "File" > "New from ACPI" 
- If you dropped the table successfully, "SSDT (CpuPm)" shouldn't be listed, unless you replaced it with a new table with the same OEM Table ID. If you created your own `SSDT-PM.aml` which is injected by OpenCore, this would be present, since it has the same OEM Table ID.

## Method 2: Dropping Tables based on Table Signature
For tables other than SSDTs, OEM Table ID isn't a reliable source to detect and drop a table by because (based on vendor) the OEM Table IDs may only contain some letters followed by a lot of blanks or underscores, for example `AMI____`. In this case, we use the `Table Signature` and `Table Length` instead to clearly identify the table.

### Example 1: dropping the `DMAR` Table

On some Z490/Z590 boards (e.g. Gigabyte), the presence of Reserved Memory Regions in the DMA Remapping Table (`DMAR`) in combination with disabled VT-d and/or `DisableIOMapper` Kernel Quirk render the dreaded on-board Intel(r) I225-V Ethernet Controller and PCIe Ethernet cards useless in macOS Monterey and newer. In this case, `DMAR` has to be modified, VT-d enabled in BIOS and `DisableIOMapper` disabled.

Therefore, you might consider dropping the `DMAR` table completely and/or replace it with a modified version. Here's how you do it:

- Open maciASL
- Select "File" > "New from ACPI"
- Pick `DMAR`
- Open the DMAR Table in maciASL and scroll to the end
- Copy the table length (in this case, `168`):</br>
	![Tlength](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76865553/139952797-38e332bc-3fed-450e-83fb-afa4a955a932.png)</br>
- Open your config and add a new rule under ACPI/Delete.
- Enter `444D4152` (HEX for "DMAR") in `TableSignature`. If you use OCAT, you can use the ASCII to HEX converter at the bottom of the app:</br>
	![Drop](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76865553/139952827-a745cf27-a1f6-416e-ba0a-0ccab3c45884.png)</br>
- In `TableLength`, enter the Length listed in the DMAR Table. In this case `168`.
- Save the Config.
- Reboot.

#### Verifying that the table has been dropped/deleted
After rebooting, do the following:

- Open maciASL
- Select "File" > "New from ACPI"
- If you dropped the table successfully, it shouldn't be listed. As you can see, it's not present:</br>
	![nodmar](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76865553/139952877-ef7d0f85-378d-4c6b-ac9a-efb7118ac4b6.png)</br>
- The table has been dropped successfully.

**NOTE**: If the table is still present, you either did something wrong or a table of the same name is present in ACPI folder and is injected by OpenCore.

### Example 2: replacing the `DMAR` table by a modified one
- Dump the ACPI Tables as explained at the beginning
- Drop the OEM `DMAR` table as explained in "Example 1"
- Modify the OEM `DMAR` Table:
	- Open it in maciASL
	- In this case we delete the `Reserved Memory Regions`:</br>
	![Delmem](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76865553/139952931-70611f4e-0773-43a9-a1c7-90faef51703b.png)</br>
- Save the file as `DMAR.aml`. It should have a new table length now (104).
- Put it in the `EFI/OC/ACPI` and add it to your `config.plist`.
- Save and reboot.

This will disable the OEM DMAR table and inject the modified one instead but we need to check if it workedâ€¦

#### Verifying that the `DMAR` Table has been replaced
- Open maciASL
- Select "File" > "New from ACPI"
- Pick `DMAR`. The file should be shorter in length than the original (in this case it's `104`) and should no longer contain Reserved Memory Regions (which it doesn't):</br>

## :warning: Note
You should only import tables with maciASL if you know these are not patched ones. Otherwise, dump the OEM ACPI Tables.

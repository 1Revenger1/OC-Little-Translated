# Obtaining an Intel Register Dump in Linux
You can use this to obtain Display Connection Data for your Intel on-board graphics. Requires working Internet connection to install the necessary tool. 

## 1. Prepare a USB stick for running Linux from an ISO:
You can skip to step 2 if you already have Linux installed

- Use a USB 3.0 flash drive (at least 8 GB or more).
- In Windows, download [**Ventoy**](https://www.ventoy.net/en/download.html) and follow the [Instructions](https://www.ventoy.net/en/doc_start.html) to prepare the flash drive. 
- Next, download an ISO of a Linux distribution of your choice, e.g. [**Ubuntu**](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop), [Zorin](https://zorin.com/os/download/) or whatever distro you prefer â€“ they all work fine.
- Copy the ISO to your newly created Ventoy stick
- Reboot from the flash drive
- In the Ventoy menu, select the Linux ISO and hit enter
- From the GNU Grub, select "Try or Install Linux"
- Once Ubuntu has reached the Desktop environment, select your language (affects Keyboard Layout as well) and click on "Try Ubuntu" (or whatever the distro of your choice prompts).

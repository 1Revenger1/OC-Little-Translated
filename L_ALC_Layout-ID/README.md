# AppleALC Guides
This section contains guides for working with the source code of the AppleALC kext for getting audio working on Hackintoshes. 

The centerpiece of this section is the guide for creating/modifying ALC Layout-IDs. Even though every step is explained in detail, the difficulty level is pretty high and following the guide and configuring your own Layout-ID is very time-consuming. Therefore, I would advise against novice users trying to create their own ALC Layout-ID.
